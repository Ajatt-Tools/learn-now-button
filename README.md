This addon adds new buttons to the card browser.
The `Learn now` button immediately puts selected new cards in the learning queue.
The `Grade now` button lets you grade selected cards without opening Reviewer.
The `Reset selected cards` button lets you delete scheduling and learning information from selected cards.

## Learn Now

Moves selected new cards to the learning queue.
The cards will be shown to you next time you go to the review screen.
You can use this feature if you have a big collection of cards,
and you find a card that you want to learn right away without manually repositioning it.

## Grade Now

Answers selected cards right from the Browser window.
For example, imagine that you learn a new Japanese word.
Then one day when reading a book in Japanese you see the word but can't recall it.
In this case it would be rational to open Anki and fail the corresponding card.
The card will be put in the relearning queue.

## Reset cards

Remove scheduling and learning information from selected cards.
The cards will become new again.
Go into the card browser,
select some cards,
and choose "Cards" > "Reset selected cards."

## Installation

Download the latest version of the addon from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1021636467),

```

## Configuration
